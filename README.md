<h1 align="center">AI Agents for Portfolio Construction</h1>


Our project aims to provide a stock screening agent that can provide buy/hold/sell signals based on historical data, and use these signals to construct a portfolio with better performance in terms of sharpe ratio.

## Available Data
- Size, book-to-value, and 12 month momentum data from CRSP/Compustat ()

## Important notebooks

- Agentics stock selection.ipynb contains the CrewAI code for LLM stock selection
- The buys and sells for year x are stored in buys_{x}.csv and sells_{x}.csv, respectively; the scoring rules and its associated explanation are in systematic_strategy_{x}.txt
- nodewise LLM.ipynb tests nodewise regression with the buys and sells generated by the LLM
- nodewise baseline.ipynb tests nodewise regression with all the S&P500 firms
